Butcher's Delight: Rechopped is a spiritual successor to the mod [Butcher's Delight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/butchers-delight). This mod features an entirely new way to manage meats, featuring a fully Create mod compatible butchering system, several new machines and tools, and many mechanics to dive into that make animals more intresting and realistic to manage.

Planned Updates: <br>
  \- 1.0: Complete reimplementation of the original mod 1:1 <br>
  \- 1.1: Make a seperate addon for [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create) compatibility <br>
  \- 1.2: Retexturing and remodeling of everything <br>

Future Concepts (may be implemented when the base mod is finished): <br>
  \- Increased realism (while maintaining simplicity) for the create addon
  \- Blood draining and other byproducts that must be managed (Like what do you do with cow eyeballs?)
  \- Slightly more realistic animal behaviour like running away (instead of running around) and attacking back randomly
